# WordPress is not WordPress.com
A tiny progressive web app outlining the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com

## What is this?

Mainly an [exercise](https://glueckpress.com/8535/pwa/) in how to make a very, very small progressive web app. You can see it live here:

## Can I contribute?

Sure! If you wish to contribute content or core, feel free [open and issue](https://github.com/glueckpress/wpistnotwp.com/issues) and or [send a pull request](https://github.com/glueckpress/wpistnotwp.com/pulls).

## I don’t see any build tools.

Right, I’m not very much into those. And while I have nothing against build tools in general, I don’t feel like adding a dozen of extra files just to update a single HTML document.

## Is this a community project?

Not really. It could become one, but it definitely is not part of the WordPress.org universe right now. In other words, this is a private project, and for now the author reserves to have the final say on any changes being proposed.

## How can I get in touch?

Ping @glueckpress on the WordPress Slack, or on Twitter.
